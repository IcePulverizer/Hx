# Hx
*H<sub>x</sub>* is an incomplete axiomatic system in propositional logic. The 144 formulas in __*data set.pdf*__ are all tautologies. 114 (actually 113) of them are provable in *H<sub>x</sub>*, and 30 of them are unprovable in *H<sub>x</sub>*. For any formula φ provable in *H<sub>x</sub>*, there is a proof of φ, and for any formula φ unprovable in *H<sub>x</sub>*, it will be proved that φ is unprovable in *H<sub>x</sub>*. Thanks for the book *Symbolic Logic* (Xu, 2008) very much, and all the basic concepts come from it.
