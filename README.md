# Hx
*H<sub>x</sub>* is an incomplete axiomatic system in propositional logic. There are 144 formulas in __*data set.pdf*__, they are all tautologies (always being true). 114 (actually 113) of them are provable in *H<sub>x</sub>*; 30 of them are unprovable in *H<sub>x</sub>*. For any formula φ provable in *H<sub>x</sub>*, there is a proof of φ; for any formula φ unprovable in *H<sub>x</sub>*, it will be proved that φ is unprovable in *H<sub>x</sub>*. Based on these formulas, it's very easy to obtain millions of formulas provable in *H<sub>x</sub>*, millions of formulas unprovable in *H<sub>x</sub>*, millions of tautologies, and  millions of contradictions (always being false).

Thanks for the book *Symbolic Logic* (Xu, 2008) very much, and all the basic concepts come from it.
